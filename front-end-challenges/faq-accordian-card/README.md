# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is my solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). It's my first time working on a project with Javascript! :tada: Any feedback is appreciated. :relaxed:

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
